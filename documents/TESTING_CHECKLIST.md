# Testing Checklist - Clerk OAuth Authentication

Use this checklist to verify the Clerk OAuth authentication implementation is working correctly.

## Pre-Testing Setup

- [ ] `.env.local` file created with Clerk credentials
- [ ] Dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- [ ] Web app `/auth/desktop` endpoint implemented
- [ ] Clerk dashboard configured with redirect URLs

## Development Testing

### 1. Protocol Registration

**macOS**:
- [ ] Run: `defaults read ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist | grep -A 5 myapp`
- [ ] Verify `myapp` protocol is listed

**Windows**:
- [ ] Run: `Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Classes\myapp"`
- [ ] Verify registry key exists

**Linux**:
- [ ] Run: `cat ~/.local/share/applications/hintify.desktop | grep myapp`
- [ ] Verify `myapp` is in MimeType

### 2. App Startup

- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] Console shows: "‚úÖ All services initialized successfully"
- [ ] Console shows: "‚úÖ Protocols registered: hintify://, myapp://"
- [ ] No authentication errors on startup

### 3. First-Time Login Flow

**Start the flow**:
- [ ] Click "Sign in with Google" button
- [ ] Console shows: "üîê Starting Clerk OAuth login..."
- [ ] Console shows state UUID generated
- [ ] Browser opens to web app

**In the browser**:
- [ ] URL includes `?state=<uuid>` parameter
- [ ] Clerk sign-in form appears
- [ ] Can sign in with Google
- [ ] After sign-in, redirects to `myapp://auth/callback?token=...&state=...`

**Back in Electron app**:
- [ ] Console shows: "üîó Processing deep link: myapp://auth/callback..."
- [ ] Console shows: "‚úÖ State parameter validated successfully"
- [ ] Console shows: "‚úÖ Token verified successfully"
- [ ] Console shows: "‚úÖ Credentials stored securely in system keychain"
- [ ] Console shows: "üéâ Clerk authentication successful"
- [ ] UI updates to show user information
- [ ] Sign-in button changes to user profile/logout

### 4. App Launch from Deep Link (App Not Running)

**Close the app completely**:
- [ ] Quit the app (Cmd+Q on macOS, Alt+F4 on Windows)
- [ ] Verify app is not running in task manager

**Trigger deep link**:
- [ ] macOS: Run `open "myapp://auth/callback?token=test&state=test"`
- [ ] Windows: Run `Start-Process "myapp://auth/callback?token=test&state=test"`
- [ ] Linux: Run `xdg-open "myapp://auth/callback?token=test&state=test"`

**Verify**:
- [ ] App launches
- [ ] Console shows: "üîó Processing deep link..."
- [ ] Error shown (expected - test token is invalid)
- [ ] No crashes

### 5. Deep Link When App Already Running

**With app running**:
- [ ] Trigger deep link again (same command as above)

**Verify**:
- [ ] App comes to foreground
- [ ] Console shows: "üîó Processing deep link..."
- [ ] No new window opens
- [ ] Single instance lock working

### 6. State Validation

**Test mismatched state**:
- [ ] Start login flow (generates state A)
- [ ] Manually trigger deep link with different state: `myapp://auth/callback?token=test&state=wrong-state`

**Verify**:
- [ ] Console shows: "‚ùå State parameter mismatch"
- [ ] Error message shown to user
- [ ] Authentication rejected
- [ ] No credentials stored

### 7. Invalid Token Rejection

**Test with invalid token**:
- [ ] Start login flow
- [ ] Manually trigger deep link with invalid token: `myapp://auth/callback?token=invalid-jwt&state=<correct-state>`

**Verify**:
- [ ] Console shows: "‚ùå Token verification failed"
- [ ] Error message shown to user
- [ ] Authentication rejected
- [ ] No credentials stored

### 8. Token Persistence Across Restarts

**After successful login**:
- [ ] Verify user is logged in
- [ ] Quit the app completely
- [ ] Restart the app

**Verify**:
- [ ] Console shows: "üîÑ Restoring Clerk session from storage..."
- [ ] Console shows: "‚úÖ Clerk session restored successfully"
- [ ] User still logged in
- [ ] UI shows user information
- [ ] No need to sign in again

### 9. Logout Functionality

**Test logout**:
- [ ] Click logout button
- [ ] Console shows: "üîì Signing out from Clerk..."

**Verify**:
- [ ] Console shows: "‚úÖ Clerk logout successful"
- [ ] UI updates to show sign-in button
- [ ] User information cleared
- [ ] Credentials removed from keychain

**After logout**:
- [ ] Quit and restart app
- [ ] Verify user is NOT logged in
- [ ] Sign-in button shown
- [ ] No session restored

### 10. Timeout Mechanism

**Test authentication timeout**:
- [ ] Click "Sign in with Google"
- [ ] Browser opens
- [ ] Wait 6 minutes (timeout is 5 minutes)
- [ ] Try to complete sign-in

**Verify**:
- [ ] Console shows: "‚è±Ô∏è Authentication timeout - state expired"
- [ ] Error message shown
- [ ] Authentication rejected
- [ ] User can retry (generates new state)

### 11. Multiple Sign-In Attempts

**Test multiple attempts**:
- [ ] Click "Sign in with Google"
- [ ] Browser opens (attempt 1)
- [ ] Don't complete sign-in
- [ ] Click "Sign in with Google" again
- [ ] Browser opens (attempt 2)
- [ ] Complete sign-in in second browser window

**Verify**:
- [ ] Second attempt succeeds
- [ ] First attempt's state is invalidated
- [ ] Only one session established
- [ ] No duplicate credentials

### 12. Network Error Handling

**Test with no internet**:
- [ ] Disconnect from internet
- [ ] Click "Sign in with Google"

**Verify**:
- [ ] Browser opens (or shows error)
- [ ] Appropriate error message shown
- [ ] App doesn't crash
- [ ] Can retry when internet restored

### 13. Concurrent Sessions

**Test with multiple devices**:
- [ ] Sign in on Device A
- [ ] Sign in on Device B (same account)

**Verify**:
- [ ] Both devices can sign in
- [ ] Each has independent session
- [ ] Logout on one doesn't affect other

## Automated Testing (Future)

Consider implementing automated tests for:

- [ ] Unit tests for ClerkAuthService
- [ ] Integration tests for IPC communication
- [ ] E2E tests for authentication flow
- [ ] Security tests for token handling
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

Example test structure:
```javascript
describe('ClerkAuthService', () => {
  test('generates valid state parameter', () => {
    const state = clerkAuthService.generateState();
    expect(state).toMatch(/^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-4[0-9a-f]{3}-[89ab][0-9a-f]{3}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/i);
  });

  test('validates matching state', () => {
    const state = clerkAuthService.generateState();
    expect(clerkAuthService.validateState(state)).toBe(true);
  });

  test('rejects mismatched state', () => {
    clerkAuthService.generateState();
    expect(clerkAuthService.validateState('wrong-state')).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

**Remember**: Security is critical. Test thoroughly before deploying to production!
